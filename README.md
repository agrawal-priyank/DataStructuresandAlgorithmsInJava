# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java
Authors: Michael T. Goodrich and Roberto Tamassia

I have implemented the following Data Structures and Abstract Data Types using Java programming language:

1. Array
2. Linked List
3. Stack
4. Queue
5. Dequeue
6. Map
7. List
8. Positional List
9. Priority Queue
10. Tree
11. Search Trees (Currently doing)

While implementing these I have used the core concepts of Object Oriented Designing which are:

1. Interface
2. Abstraction
3. Encapsulation
4. Polymorphism

I have simultaneously practiced some problem solving programs as well that are related to the above mentioned Data Structures and Abstract Data Types
